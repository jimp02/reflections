When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote is used most of the time in addition to local. It allowa multiple people to commit to
    the project. It provides off-site backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want only your changes, not the changes of other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of someone else's repository on github.
	Clone is a copy of my repository on a local mackine.
	Branch is a different set of commits on my local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I have no idea!!!!

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Talk to people if they are available.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I don't want to ever make changes to a separate branch.
