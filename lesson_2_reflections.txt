What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It adds a .git directory to the folder.
    It creats a repository. The files are listed with "git status" as untracked.
	Nothing is added to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What
value do you think it offers?

	The staging area stores information from the working directory without updating
	the repositiry. It allows several logical changes to be tested before making a
	repository commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Files can be added to the staging area without updating the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

	Branches are used when you want to make changes that are not part of the master branch.
	The branches can be updated independently of the master branch.
