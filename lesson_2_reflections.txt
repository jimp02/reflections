What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It adds a .git directory to the folder.
    It creats a repository. The files are listed with "git status" as untracked.
	Nothing is added to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What
value do you think it offers?

	The staging area stores information from the working directory without updating
	the repositiry. It allows several logical changes to be tested before making a
	repository commit.
